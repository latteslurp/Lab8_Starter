1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
2) If we only care about one specific function's outcome, unit testing would be more ideal. (no)
3) No. Because we want to be able to check the message written to the user and received by the user. I think E2E testing would fit better in this scenario.
4) Yes. Since the main goal here is only to check max message length, unit testing should satisfy that objective.
